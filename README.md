# Network-Traffic-Anamoly-Detection
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying suspicious activities, cyber threats, and unusual traffic patterns in network security.
